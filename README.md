## Introduction

Welcome to the hands-on guide for building a Voice AI Agent using n8n and Vapi! This guide is based on the monthly workshop series and YouTube lectures by Aemal Sayer. Youâ€™ll learn how to create an AI agent that can read and reply to emails, integrate with Google Docs, and extend with custom logicâ€”all with best practices and real-world tips.

## Prerequisites

- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) (Open source workflow automation)
- [Vapi](https://vapi.ai/) (Voice AI agent platform)
- [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for running n8n locally)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)

**Best Practices:**
- Use a separate Google account for testing automation
- Store credentials securely (use .env files, never commit secrets)
- Use version control for your workflows and scripts
- Always test in a development environment first



## General Instructions

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

- Create a free account on [N8N](https://n8n.io/) (14 days trail)
- Create a free account on [Vapi](https://vapi.ai/)

### 2. Building Your First Voice AI Agent in Vapi

- Log into Vapi and create a new agent
- Configure voice, prompt, and assistant settings


### 3. Creating Workflows in n8n

- Create a new N8N workflow (Andrea)
- Add nodes: Trigger, AI Agent, Gmail, Google Docs, etc.
- Connect your Google account


### 4. Integrating Vapi with n8n

- Use webhook nodes to connect Vapi and n8n


### 5. Extending with Custom Logic (Vibe Coding)
