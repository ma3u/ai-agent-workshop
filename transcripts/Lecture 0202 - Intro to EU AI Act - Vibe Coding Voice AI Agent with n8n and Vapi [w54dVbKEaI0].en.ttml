<p begin="00:00:00.880" end="00:00:06.799" style="s2">So all AI</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.919" end="00:00:09.920" style="s2">applications can be classified through a</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.799" end="00:00:12.639" style="s2">framework called EO AI act in four</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.920" end="00:00:14.280" style="s2">different categories. It&#39;s basically an</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.639" end="00:00:17.440" style="s2">act to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.280" end="00:00:19.920" style="s2">European Union uh level. And let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.440" end="00:00:23.519" style="s2">a quick look at that.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:26.240" style="s2">So before we start uh and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.519" end="00:00:29.599" style="s2">what is EOI act um I would like to make</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.240" end="00:00:30.840" style="s2">a disclaimer that I&#39;m not a lawyer and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.599" end="00:00:36.079" style="s2">neither</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.840" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">liar. Um I want to be clear with this</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.079" end="00:00:42.520" style="s2">message that um these are just some</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:45.680" style="s2">slides. Don&#39;t take it as a legal</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.520" end="00:00:49.280" style="s2">advice. Before we move on, let&#39;s have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.680" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">quick um metaphor of what are traffic</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.280" end="00:00:56.800" style="s2">lights for or why EOI act is there. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">basically there to prevent accidents the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.800" end="00:01:00.520" style="s2">same way as traffic lights are there to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">prevent</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.520" end="00:01:08.840" style="s2">accidents. AI is an extremely powerful</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:13.119" style="s2">tool. If it is used incorrectly, it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.840" end="00:01:17.119" style="s2">will create arm and that arm can be</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.119" end="00:01:20.080" style="s2">catastrophic and big. So what is it</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.119" end="00:01:24.320" style="s2">protecting? This EUAI act is protecting</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.080" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">our 50 European values which are across</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.320" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">these six pillars. Human dignity,</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">freedom, democracy, equality, rule of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:35.439" style="s2">law and human rights.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:38.320" style="s2">And whatever you build, whatever AI</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.439" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">application you build, it will have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.320" end="00:01:44.720" style="s2">be regulated and it will be classified</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">as one of uh four categories that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.720" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">see in a minute. First thing first, how</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">do you find it? You just go to Google,</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:55.720" style="s2">search for EUAI act, and make sure you</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">download the one that is from Eurollex</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.720" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">Europa. It&#39;s 144 pages long. You can</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:05.479" style="s2">even load it back to chat GPT and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">ask questions from</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.479" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">it. So basically any EU AI or EU um</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:16.440" style="s2">application can be classified as one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">these risk levels. If you build an AI</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.440" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">application, it can be of a risk level</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:27.040" style="s2">that&#39;s not accepted or it&#39;s prohibited</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:29.000" style="s2">in EU or that has high risk of ARM and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">therefore it has to go through a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.000" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">regulation limited risk limited</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">regulation or minimal risk not too much</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:40.480" style="s2">of regulation is needed to implement</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">that AI application in general public.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">So let&#39;s have a quick look at each of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:48.840" style="s2">them.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">So starting from minimal risk, um an</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">email filter, a Gmail email filter can</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">be classified as a minimal risk. A</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">chatbot answering questions can be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">minimal risk. An AI powered bookkeeping</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">or accounting or expense management can</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">be classified as an minimal risk. Why?</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.319" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">because the data is literally in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">system and you&#39;re you have rights to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:17.159" style="s2">modify the data and you&#39;re moving it</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:20.360" style="s2">from one side to other</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.159" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">side. Limited risk could be deep fake</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.360" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">generators, AI generated images or</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:28.800" style="s2">videos uh must disclose their synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:31.560" style="s2">nature. They should be mentioning that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.800" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">this is an AI generated</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.560" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">video. An AI recommendation system,</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">products or content recommendations that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">usually e-commerce shops use, they will</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:45.920" style="s2">go through limited risk or transparency</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">requirements, also known as AI powered</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.920" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">r√© screeners can be limited risk. They</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">must inform users that they are being</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:58.040" style="s2">assessed by an AI</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">audits should be uh done for</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.120" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">those AI applications can be in the</p>

<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">regulations because it is classified as</p>

<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:02.280" style="s2">process. That means a lot of regulations</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">has to be done in order for that AI</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.280" end="00:05:07.240" style="s2">applications to be uh rolled out to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.240" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">public. What is prohibited in Germany</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.560" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">and as well in entire Europe? uh the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">type of AI applications that uh can go</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">towards the social scoring systems, an</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">AI application that ranks individuals</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">based on their behaviors that they do in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">the society on a daily basis.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:33.759" style="s2">Realtime biometric surveillance like</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:36.160" style="s2">facial recognitions used for mass</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.759" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">surveillance in public spaces like train</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.160" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">stations, bus stations and so on places</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">where people walk by and their faces are</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">screened through an AI screening and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">surveillance system. AI for predictive</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:55.639" style="s2">policing systems that forecast crime</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">like likelihood based on bias data. For</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.639" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">example, if somebody has a lot of data</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:05.840" style="s2">of their whatever driving experience or</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">driving penalties or tickets and things</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.840" end="00:06:11.160" style="s2">that they have been receiving based on</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">that data, they will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.160" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">penalized. Further down the road, that</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:19.680" style="s2">is absolutely prohibited. These are the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.160" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">types of AI applications that are banned</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">for ethical and safety reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">So basically a EU AI act is a framework</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">EU level and it has to be implemented</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s already rolling out the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">education of this EU literacy has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:42.360" style="s2">already mandatory on allmemes since</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:46.039" style="s2">February 2025 and from August</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.360" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">2025 the general purpose AI um</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.039" end="00:06:52.919" style="s2">applications will be also um rolled out.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">It is going to roll out until</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.919" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">2026 and it&#39;s a very important topic</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">that we should always talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">therefore I felt the obligation to cover</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">it in my course. See you in the next</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">one.</p>
