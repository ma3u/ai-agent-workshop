# AI Agent Lectures â€“ Expert Summary

## Lecture 0101 â€“ Quick Demo of What We Will Be Building
 This lecture introduces the course, explains the project objective (building a voice AI agent that interacts with your Gmail inbox), and outlines the structure of the workshop series. It describes the practical use cases, the agent's capabilities (reading and composing emails), and the tools you'll use (Vapi, n8n, custom coding). The instructor demonstrates how the agent can be triggered via Siri and used hands-free while driving, emphasizing accessibility and real-world application. No coding experience is required, but having some helps.

## Final Remarks

Well done! You have completed this amazing crash course where you learned how to build a voice agent that talks to your Gmail inbox. In the process, you learned how to use Vapi and n8n, and a little bit about vibe coding.

If you would like to attend one of my workshops, you can scan the QR code or go to the address provided to register for MetJune. It does not matter if you are based in Berlin or from around the globeâ€”my workshops are happening in a hybrid format. I will live stream the event and also have some people in person. The next workshop is on the 17th of May, and we are expecting around 100 to 120 people in-house and over 380 people registered already, with many joining online as well.

I wish you good luck with your vibe coding and with your AI agent development journey. See you in the next tutorial. Bye!
